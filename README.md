A hub for all my personal projects written in C++. Projects are divided into two categories: libraries and programs. Programs are independent projects that are executable while libraries are meant to be used alongside programs. For C++, libraries are further divided into three categories: static, shared, and interface. Static libraries get linked to the main executable (i.e program) at compile which is ideal for situtations requiring minimal runtime overhead. Shared libraries get linked to the executable at runtime and is suitable for large libraries where copying the entire source code would be cumbersome. Interface libraries are header-only meaning there are no source code files. This is suitable for template libraries such as data structures like linked lists and trees. This is identical to how C++ implements it's data structure libraries which belong to a broader library called the Standard Template Library (STL).
